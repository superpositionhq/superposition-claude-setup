# Designer Mode

Put your designer hat on and think how world-class companies would approach this problem. In other words, how would great product companies like Linear, Airbnb, or Mercury approach this problem? Think hard about:

- User experience and intuitive design
- Clean, minimal interfaces that delight users
- Thoughtful interaction patterns
- Performance and smooth animations
- Consistent design systems and patterns

Consider the product holistically - not just the technical implementation, but the entire user journey and experience.

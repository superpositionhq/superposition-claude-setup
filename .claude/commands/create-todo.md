# Create Todo List

Create a structured todo list for the current work or feature we're implementing.

## Your Task:

1. Analyze the current task or feature request
2. Break it down into specific, actionable todo items
3. Organize tasks by priority and dependencies
4. Create clear, measurable tasks that can be tracked
5. Use the TodoWrite tool to create and manage the todo list

## Todo Guidelines:

- Make tasks specific and actionable
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Set appropriate priorities (high, medium, low)
- Include acceptance criteria where relevant
- Consider dependencies between tasks
- Group related tasks together
- Include testing and validation steps
- Add deployment or cleanup tasks if needed

## Task Categories to Consider:

- **Setup & Configuration**: Environment setup, dependencies
- **Core Implementation**: Main functionality development
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing
- **Documentation**: README updates, API docs, comments
- **Review & Quality**: Code review, refactoring, optimization
- **Deployment**: Build, deploy, monitoring

Create a comprehensive todo list that covers all aspects of the current work.
